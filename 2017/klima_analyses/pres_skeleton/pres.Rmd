## Our problems

- Food outbreak
    - Many exposures to food products
- Risk factors
    - Is playing with dogs/cats/rats a risk factor for campylobacter infection?
    - Is owning a dog/cat/bird a risk factor for campylobacter infection?
- Gene analyses
    - Which genes are associated with the outcome?

## Traditional methods

- (Many) univariable analyses
- Forwards/backwards stepwise selection
- Everything in the same model
